# Machine Learning - Linear Regression

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project and give pointers as to where to get the required libraries to run the program.

### Prerequisites
These are the required libraries, programs and packages you need to run the program.
* [Python 3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/)
* [TensorFlow 1.10.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

### Installing

## Assignment
The data sets ([resources](/res)) contains data about babies. Create a visualisation of the data models after optimization and print the loss value for the model. The two data sets [length and weight](/res/length_weight.csv) and [age in days, length and weight](/res/day_length_weight.csv) will be used by linear regression models, while the last set [age in days and head circumference](/res/day_head_circumference.csv) be used in a non-linear model. The non-linear model will use the following formula as prediction: f(x) = 20&sigma;(xW + b) + 31
